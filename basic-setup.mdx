## System Requirements

- **A Packetmanager of your Choice**
- **A Mailblock account** - Follow the setup guide below

## Setting Up Your Mailblock Account

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up for a Mailblock account to get started with our email service:

👉 [**Sign Up for Mailblock**](https://www.mailblock.de/#beta)

### Step 2: Configure Your Custom Domain

To send emails, you need a verified domain. Mailblock offers two convenient options:

#### Option A: Use Your Existing Domain

- **Add your own domain** and configure the DNS settings
- **Complete domain verification** process
- **Set up email authentication** (DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records)
- **Benefits**: Use your branded domain, full control
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes setup \+ DNS propagation

#### Option B: Purchase a Pre-configured Domain ⭐ Recommended

- **Buy one of our pre-configured domains** that are already warmed up
- **Ready to use immediately** with optimal deliverability rates
- **No DNS configuration required** - everything is handled for you
- **Benefits**: Instant setup, better deliverability, no technical hassle
- **Time**: 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Generate Your API Key

Once your domain is configured and verified:

#### 1. Navigate to API Keys

In your Mailblock dashboard, go to the API Keys section:

<img
  src="/images/mockups/nav-mockup.png"
  alt="Nav Mockup Pn"
  title="Nav Mockup Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"43%" }}
/>

#### 2. Create Your API Key

Click "Create New API Key" and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production API", "Development Key"):

![Api Key Mockup Pn](/images/mockups/api-key-mockup.png)

#### 3. Store Your API Key Securely

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

- **Copy your API key immediately** - it won't be shown again
- **Store it in a secure location** (password manager, environment variables)
- **Never commit API keys to version control** (git repositories)
- **Use environment variables** for production applications
- **Regenerate keys** if you suspect they've been compromised

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Before proceeding with the SDK, it's important to verify that everything is configured correctly:

#### Use the Verify Domain Button

Click the **"Verify Domain"** button in your dashboard to check if all settings are properly configured:

![Verify Pn](/images/mockups/verify.png)

The verification process will check:

✅ **Domain Status**: Should show "Verified" in your dashboard\
✅ **DNS Records**: All authentication records should be "Active"\
✅ **DKIM Configuration**: Proper email signing setup\
✅ **SPF Record**: Sender authentication configured\
✅ **DMARC Policy**: Email security policy in place\
✅ **API Key**: Successfully created and stored securely\
✅ **Sending Limits**: Check your current sending quota

💡 **Tip**: If any checks fail, the verification tool will provide specific instructions on how to fix each issue.

## Environment Setup Best Practices

### For Development

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env file
MAILBLOCK_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
MAILBLOCK_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### For Production

Set environment variables on your hosting platform:

```bash
# Example for various platforms
# Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.
MAILBLOCK_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
MAILBLOCK_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Domain not verified" Error

- **Check DNS records** - ensure all required records are added
- **Wait for propagation** - DNS changes can take up to 24 hours
- **Contact support** if verification fails after 24 hours

### "Invalid API key" Error

- **Double-check the key** - ensure no extra spaces or characters
- **Verify key is active** - check dashboard for key status
- **Regenerate if needed** - create a new key if the old one doesn't work

### "Sending quota exceeded" Error

- **Check your limits** in the dashboard
- **Upgrade your plan** if you need higher limits
- **Wait for quota reset** (usually monthly)
